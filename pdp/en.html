    <h1>Privacy Policy - Kash Bot</h1>
    <p>By using Kash Bot, you agree to all the Terms of Use.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 User Data</h3>
    <p>User Data includes, but is not limited to, User IDs, User IPs, user emails, profile pictures, usernames, and user
        tags (“discriminator”). The Kash Team uses User Data as a means to personalize your experience and assist you in
        any way possible. This usage may include, but is not limited to, debugging information for commands like
        "suggest" or support information to identify a user, use in message embeds, and logging regarding user and
        command usage.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Guild Data</h3>
    <p>Guild Data includes, but is not limited to, Guild IDs, Guild icons, Guild names, member count, roles, channels,
        and roles held by a member. Guild Data is used as a further means to personalize your experience and assist you
        in ways that User Data may not be helpful. This usage may include, but is not limited to, debugging information
        for commands like "suggest" or support information to identify a guild, use in message embeds, and logging
        regarding command usage. Additionally, developers may use Guild Data in any way needed, as long as it is not
        used for malicious purposes. Developers reserve the right to generate an invite to a guild to provide support or
        determine if the guild is abusing our bots.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Use and Storage of User Data and Guild Data</h3>
    <p>The Kash Team reserves the right to use and store User Data and Guild Data in any way necessary for the
        functionality of our bots. The Kash Team will not use User Data or Guild Data for malicious purposes, only when
        required for specific commands or features of our bots. User and Guild Data will only be stored in specific
        situations where it is necessary for the persistence of a feature. This includes, but is not limited to, user
        currency, event logs, blacklists, and access to specific benefits.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information to provide the Kash Bot service to you, personalizing and improving our services. We may
        also contact you if necessary. The Kash Team reserves the right to remove and permanently delete your bot
        content or data, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason.</p>
