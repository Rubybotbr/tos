    <h2>Rights to Use the Service</h2>

        permission for it to access and interact with your server data as necessary to function. You must be at least 13
        years old to use Kash Bot. If you are between 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have the
        consent of a legal guardian.</p>

        <li>Using the bot for unlawful or unauthorized purposes;</li>
        <li>Interfering with the operation of Kash Bot or the Discord platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bot & Guilds</h2>
    <p>The Kash Bot team reserves the right to remove Kash Bot from any guild at any time. We may remove Kash Bot from a
        server for reasons such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) The guild is abusing the bot, causing operational issues;</li>
        <li>(b) The guild is defaming the reputation of Kash Bot, the Kash Team, Klee, or any project contributors;</li>
        <li>(c) We do not wish for our services to be associated with the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bans from Official Servers</h2>
    <p>If you are banned from any guild related to Kash Bot or the Kash Team for any reason, we may apply a ban and
        blacklist you on our other servers and services.</p>

    <h2>Bot Spam and Abuse</h2>
    <p>If you spam commands or abuse any of our services in any way, you will be blacklisted and banned from our
        services. We will also add you to Discord's ban lists and alert other bot developers about your conduct. In
        cases of serious violations (such as: raids, harassment, and other violations), you may be banned from all
        servers where Kash Bot is present.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods</h2>
    <p>The Service may include the opportunity to obtain virtual currency ("Virtual Currency") or virtual goods
        ("Virtual Goods"), which may require you to pay a fee using real money to obtain Virtual Currency or Virtual
        Goods. Your purchase of Virtual Currency is final and non-refundable, non-exchangeable, or non-transferable,
        except at the sole discretion of the Company or the platform provider. You may not buy, sell, or trade Virtual
        Currency outside of the Service. Doing so is a violation of the Terms and may result in the termination of your
        Account with the Service and/or legal action. The Company reserves the right to modify, manage, control, and/or
        eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods at its sole discretion. Prices and availability of Virtual Goods
        are subject to change without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for the exercise of these
        rights. You have a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use, solely within the
        Service, the Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you have earned, purchased, or otherwise obtained in an
        authorized manner from the Company. You have no other rights, title, or interest in or to any Virtual Goods or
        Virtual Currency appearing or originating in the Service.</p>

    <p>In the case of a chargeback, the Company reserves the right to issue a notice of the violation or immediately
        terminate or suspend any or all Accounts that you have created using the Service and reserves the right to also
        terminate or suspend other accounts in other services.</p>

        with our policies. We will create an official list of who can sell Virtual Currency for real money. Unauthorized
        sale of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods may result in legal actions.</p>

    <h2>Modifications to the Terms</h2>

        website or via notifications on Discord. Continued use of Kash Bot after modifications implies acceptance of the
        new conditions.</p>
